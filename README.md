# vagrant-lab
Provision VMs for Development Labs.
---
## **Context**

This repository arose from the need for constant provisioning of virtual machines for studies and development tests.


## **Requirements**

- **Vagrant**

First of all, it is required the [vagrant binary package](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads). For more instructions about Vagrant Installation, access this [link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install?product_intent=vagrant).

  Check if vagrant is installed.

```bash
  vagrant version
```

```
# Output example:
  Installed Version: 2.3.4
  Latest Version: 2.3.4
```

- **Oracle Virtualbox**

If you don't have Oracle Virtualbox installed, access this [link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to install Virtualbox on your operating system.

## **Setting up this Project**

#### **Considerations**

- Optionally for this project, we have chosen to use [Alma Linux 8](https://app.vagrantup.com/almalinux/boxes/8).
- The network is configured for use in bridge mode.
- For provisioning, the same user used on the host will be created, adding it with sudo permissions.
- In this project, a mount point is being created between the hypervisor and the VMS). *It is optional (fell free to comment this line if you don't want to use it)*.
- Configure shell provisioning according to your needs.
- In order to make this environment shareable, the implementation of variables using the [**vagrant-env**](https://github.com/gosuri/vagrant-env) **plugin** is being used:

```sh
cd AlmaLinux8
vagrant plugin install vagrant-env
```

This plugin enables loading variables from `.env` file where we are defining the following parameters:

```yaml
# Create `.env` in the same path where Vagrantfile is located.

vim .env

# `.env` Required arguments:
PUBKEY=''
IFACE=''
RANGE=''
NETMASK=''
GATEWAY=''
```

**`.env`** (example):

```yaml
  # Variables Environment
  PUBKEY='ssh-rsa AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5BBADE6VZXR7....'
  IFACE='eth0'
  RANGE='192.168.0.'
  NETMASK='255.255.255.0'
  GATEWAY='192.168.0.1'
```

- **username**:  *It will capture your current host user and create it on the VMs.*
- **interface**: *Interface name of your host for bridge network configuration.*
- **range**: *Ips range based on your local network to create machines.*
- **netmask**: *Check your host network configurations.*
- **gateway**: *Default gateway of your local network.*
- **pubkey**: *Your public ssh key string that will be added to authorized_keys.*

*Note: Inside of `Vagrantfile` it is also possible to customize the following extra arguments:

- **hostname**: Set to `lab`. Change to desired Hostname index.
- **ip range index**: Set to `10`. Change to desired IP index.
- **synced_folder**: Change to your desired source/destination folders or omment if you don't want to use it (*Optional*).
- **memory**: *VMs memory*
- **cpu**: *VMs CPU*
- **num_vms**:  *Number of VMs to be created.*

## **Let's running!**

Before spinning up this lab, download the Alma Linux 8 box:

```sh
vagrant box add almalinux/8 --force
```

**Example:**
```sh
vagrant box add almalinux/8 --force
==> box: Loading metadata for box 'almalinux/8'
    box: URL: https://vagrantcloud.com/almalinux/8
This box can work with multiple providers! The providers that it
can work with are listed below. Please review the list and choose
the provider you will be working with.

1) hyperv
2) libvirt
3) virtualbox
4) vmware_desktop

Enter your choice: 3
==> box: Adding box 'almalinux/8' (v8.7.20230228) for provider: virtualbox
    box: Downloading: https://vagrantcloud.com/almalinux/boxes/8/versions/8.7.20230228/providers/virtualbox.box
    box: Calculating and comparing box checksum...
==> box: Successfully added box 'almalinux/8' (v8.7.20230228) for 'virtualbox'!
```

After configuring the `Vagrantfile`, go to the directory where it is located and run:

```bash
cd AlmaLinux8
source .env
vagrant up
```

That's it. You will have an environment according to your settings. Enjoy!
